// adding new to-dos
	// the user can entire free form text and have it parsed into what it is

// command interface
	// tbd


// selecting and updating todos
	// the user either operates on the stack, or on a query
		// on a query-- the user can select an item from a list using a key and cross it off
			// querys can take the form of 
				// date
				// grep
				// hashtag

		// on a stack -- the user can cross off the current todo
			// the current to-do is the most recent todo on the top of the list, or it is on its next iteration (in the case of a user adding a to do before the current todo is complete)

	// in the future the user will be able to focus on a query, and have it take the postion of the stack, with the current to-do operating on it vs the whole stack.
